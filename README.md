Before you can start working on DevSpace, you need to have Node.js
installed on your machine. The currently supported versions are `10.15.0` or greater.

To download Node.js visit https://nodejs.org/en/download/.

_NOTE: You can use a tool like [`NVM`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
or [`N`](https://github.com/tj/n) to install and manage multiple node versions_

#### Verify Prerequisites

You can verify your setup by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
$ node -v
```

### Install Dependencies

Once you have Node.js and `yarn` installed on your machine and have validated
that you are running the proper version, you can set up the development environment
by running the following at the root of DevSpace:

```bash
$ npm i
$ cd client
$ npm i
```

## Running devSpace on your local server
